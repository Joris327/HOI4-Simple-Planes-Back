This repository contains a mod for Hearts of iron 4. A grand strategy game set during world war 2 by Paradox Interactive.

At some point Paradox released an expasion for the game called By Blood Alone, which among other things introduced a new modular system for customising your planes.
While I personally I am a fan, some people don't always wish to have to bother with designing planes and just want a plane to put into production ofter the research is done.
That is where this mod comes in, now both systems are available at the same time so you have ultimate control over how much you (don't) want to interact with the new system.
